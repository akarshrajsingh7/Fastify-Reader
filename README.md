As someone who is knee-deep in prep for my master exam, I found myself wishing for a way to breeze through texts faster. Fast forward few hours,  I ended up writing a code to do the same. And thatâ€™s when I realised, it actually works. So sharing it with you all! 

ðŸš€ðŸš€ Excited to introduce  - Fastify ReaderðŸ“š - the app that turbocharges your reading speed!  Inspired by concepts like Bionic Reading, it lets you devour text at lightning speed and somehow also enables you to grasp concepts in texts much faster!
